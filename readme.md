# Fix it Flex

<p>
  Creat responsive web pages with grids. Flexbox allows you to do that with just a few CSS code lines.<br />
  The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (a W3C Candidate Recommendation as of October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items      in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).<br /><br />
  The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes).<br />
  A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
